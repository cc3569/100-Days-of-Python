print("Hello World!" + "\n")
# print("Hello World!) will cause an error
    # SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal

print("print('what to print')" + "\n")
# The single quotation marks allows for the system to print
# the following statement without throwing a Syntax Error:
#       print('what to print')
#
# If there are double quotations in place, a syntax error will 
# be thrown to the end user/programmer.

print("Hello World!\n" * 3 + "\n")
# The following code will output:
#   Hello World!
#   Hello World!
#   Hello World!
