### STRINGS ###

# Strings are a series of characters surrounded by quotation marks.
# Strings can represent words, phrases, etc.

print("Hello"[0] + "\n")

# The "[0]" refers to the first index of the string "Hello". The
# console will print the first character of this string. The console
# will output the following: "H"

print("Hello"[4] + "\n")

# This statement prints "o" to the console terminal.

print("123" + "456\n")
# The statement will concatenate the two strings rather than adding
# the two numbers together. The console will out "123456"

### INTEGERS ###

print(123 + 456)
print("\n") # *Statement for new lines*

# This statement will add the two numbers together and output the
# result out to the console. The result is an integer value (number)
#   Result: 579

### FLOATS ###

# Floats are integers that have decimal places.

print(3.14159)
print("\n") # *Statement for new lines*

### BOOLEANS ###

# Booleans are a data type that can only be true or false

trueVar = True
falseVar = False

print(trueVar)
print(falseVar)
